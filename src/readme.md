# Notes on project

## Naming convention:
- Class that represents **page with defined route** is appended with **"Layout"** (e.g. CategoryEditLayout, MainLayout)
- **Reusable** views is appended with **"Component"** (e.g. BookDefinitionPreview)
- Components, that are purely **user input** forms instead appended with **"Form"** (e.g. BookDefinitionEditForm)
